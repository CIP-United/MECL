/**
  @defgroup BiquadCascadeDF1 Biquad Cascade IIR Filters Using Direct Form I Structure

  This set of functions implements arbitrary order recursive (IIR) filters.
  The filters are implemented as a cascade of second order Biquad sections.
  The functions support Q15, Q31 and floating-point data types.
  Fast version of Q15 and Q31 also available.

  The functions operate on blocks of input and output data and each call to the function
  processes <code>blockSize</code> samples through the filter.
  <code>pSrc</code> points to the array of input data and
  <code>pDst</code> points to the array of output data.
  Both arrays contain <code>blockSize</code> values.

  @par           Algorithm
                   Each Biquad stage implements a second order filter using the difference equation:
  <pre>
      y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n-1] + b2 * x[n-2] + a1 * y[n-1] + a2 * y[n-2]
  </pre>
                  A Direct Form I algorithm is used with 5 coefficients and 4 state variables per stage.
                  \image html Biquad.gif "Single Biquad filter stage"
                  Coefficients <code>b0, b1 and b2 </code> multiply the input signal <code>x[n]</code> and are referred to as the feedforward coefficients.
                  Coefficients <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> multiply the output signal <code>y[n]</code> and are referred to as the feedback coefficients.
                  Pay careful attention to the sign of the feedback coefficients.
                  Some design tools use the difference equation
  <pre>
      y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n-1] + b2 * x[n-2] - a1 * y[n-1] - a2 * y[n-2]
  </pre>
                  In this case the feedback coefficients <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code>
                  must be negated when used with the MIPS Embedded Compute Library.

  @par
                   Higher order filters are realized as a cascade of second order sections.
                   <code>numStages</code> refers to the number of second order stages used.
                   For example, an 8th order filter would be realized with <code>numStages=4</code> second order stages.
                   \image html BiquadCascade.gif "8th order filter using a cascade of Biquad stages"
                   A 9th order filter would be realized with <code>numStages=5</code> second order stages with the coefficients for one of the stages configured as a first order filter (<code>b2=0</code> and <code>a2=0</code>).

  @par
                   The <code>pState</code> points to state variables array.
                   Each Biquad stage has 4 state variables <code>x[n-1], x[n-2], y[n-1],</code> and <code>y[n-2]</code>.
                   The state variables are arranged in the <code>pState</code> array as:
  <pre>
      {x[n-1], x[n-2], y[n-1], y[n-2]}
  </pre>

  @par
                   The 4 state variables for stage 1 are first, then the 4 state variables for stage 2, and so on.
                   The state array has a total length of <code>4*numStages</code> values.
                   The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed, the coefficients are untouched.

  @par           Instance Structure
                   The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
                   A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
                   Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable arrays cannot be shared.
                   There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.

  @par           Init Function
                   There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
                   The initialization function performs following operations:
                   - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
                   - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
                   To do this manually without calling the init function, assign the follow subfields of the instance structure:
                   numStages, pCoeffs, pState. Also set all of the values in pState to zero.

  @par
                   Use of the initialization function is optional.
                   However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
                   To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
                   Set the values in the state buffer to zeros before static initialization.
                   The code below statically initializes each of the 3 different data type filter instance structures
  <pre>
      mips_biquad_casd_df1_inst_f32 S1 = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs};
      mips_biquad_casd_df1_inst_q15 S2 = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs, postShift};
      mips_biquad_casd_df1_inst_q31 S3 = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs, postShift};
  </pre>
                   where <code>numStages</code> is the number of Biquad stages in the filter;
                   <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer;
                   <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer;
                   <code>postShift</code> shift to be applied.

  @par           Fixed-Point Behavior
                   Care must be taken when using the Q15 and Q31 versions of the Biquad Cascade filter functions.
                   Following issues must be considered:
                   - Scaling of coefficients
                   - Filter gain
                   - Overflow and saturation

  @par           Scaling of coefficients
                   Filter coefficients are represented as fractional values and
                   coefficients are restricted to lie in the range <code>[-1 +1)</code>.
                   The fixed-point functions have an additional scaling parameter <code>postShift</code>
                   which allow the filter coefficients to exceed the range <code>[+1 -1)</code>.
                   At the output of the filter's accumulator is a shift register which shifts the result by <code>postShift</code> bits.
                   \image html BiquadPostshift.gif "Fixed-point Biquad with shift by postShift bits after accumulator"
                   This essentially scales the filter coefficients by <code>2^postShift</code>.
                   For example, to realize the coefficients
  <pre>
     {1.5, -0.8, 1.2, 1.6, -0.9}
  </pre>
                   set the pCoeffs array to:
  <pre>
     {0.75, -0.4, 0.6, 0.8, -0.45}
  </pre>
                   and set <code>postShift=1</code>

  @par           Filter gain
                   The frequency response of a Biquad filter is a function of its coefficients.
                   It is possible for the gain through the filter to exceed 1.0 meaning that the filter increases the amplitude of certain frequencies.
                   This means that an input signal with amplitude < 1.0 may result in an output > 1.0 and these are saturated or overflowed based on the implementation of the filter.
                   To avoid this behavior the filter needs to be scaled down such that its peak gain < 1.0 or the input signal must be scaled down so that the combination of input and filter are never overflowed.

  @par           Overflow and saturation
                   For Q15 and Q31 versions, it is described separately as part of the function specific documentation below.
