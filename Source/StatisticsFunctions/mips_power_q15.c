/**
  @brief         Sum of the squares of the elements of a Q15 vector.
  @param[in]     pSrc       points to the input vector
  @param[in]     blockSize  number of samples in input vector
  @param[out]    pResult    sum of the squares value returned here
  @return        none

  @par           Scaling and Overflow Behavior
                   The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.
                   The input is represented in 1.15 format.
                   Intermediate multiplication yields a 2.30 format, and this
                   result is added without saturation to a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.
                   With 33 guard bits in the accumulator, there is no risk of overflow, and the
                   full precision of the intermediate multiplication is preserved.
                   Finally, the return result is in 34.30 format.
