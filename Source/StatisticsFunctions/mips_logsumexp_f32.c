/**
 * @brief Computation of the LogSumExp
 *
 * In probabilistic computations, the dynamic of the probability values can be very
 * wide because they come from gaussian functions.
 * To avoid underflow and overflow issues, the values are represented by their log.
 * In this representation, multiplying the original exp values is easy : their logs are added.
 * But adding the original exp values is requiring some special handling and it is the
 * goal of the LogSumExp function.
 *
 * If the values are x1...xn, the function is computing:
 *
 * ln(exp(x1) + ... + exp(xn)) and the computation is done in such a way that
 * rounding issues are minimised.
 *
 * The max xm of the values is extracted and the function is computing:
 * xm + ln(exp(x1 - xm) + ... + exp(xn - xm))
 *
 * @param[in]  *in         Pointer to an array of input values.
 * @param[in]  blockSize   Number of samples in the input array.
 * @return LogSumExp
 *
