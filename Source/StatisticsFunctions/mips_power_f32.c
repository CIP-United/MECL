/**
  @defgroup power Power

  Calculates the sum of the squares of the elements in the input vector.
  The underlying algorithm is used:

  <pre>
      Result = pSrc[0] * pSrc[0] + pSrc[1] * pSrc[1] + pSrc[2] * pSrc[2] + ... + pSrc[blockSize-1] * pSrc[blockSize-1];
  </pre>

  There are separate functions for floating point, Q31, Q15, and Q7 data types.

  Since the result is not divided by the length, those functions are in fact computing
  something which is more an energy than a power.
